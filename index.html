            Hi everying!
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Chet Budhathoki. I was always fascinated with computer and technology ever since I started
            learning computer. Information technology was very foreign to me growing up. There were literally handful of
            people who knew how to operate computer let alone Web Development.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, life happens. Never took any course of action to make IT as my professional career. Now, looking at
            my interest and the job market, I thought going into IT would definitely make sence. Especially becoming a
            Web Developer is so much fun because I can literally spend 8 hours trying to put my pictures in HTML and
            still can't figure it out how to do it.
